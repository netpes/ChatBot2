realtime error:

    description:
        sender cant see his message after he send it.

    in depth:
        socket dont update the sender, probably relate to rooms.

    conclusions:
        1. the chat updates in the server, console.log, prints from the DB request
        2. bot also cause the same problem.
        3. io.sockets keeps to push all messages to all users.
        4. because of FrontEnd solution you can see the message for 0.1 sec and after the socket connects, the message disappears.
        5. RT works for chats, but admin reciving the data from user



Bot Bug:
    1. double values in DB
    2. cant export - fixed
    3. RT - fixed


Bot improve:
    stores variant of the answers in array, and return the most answered question.
